ai_orchestrator package bootstrap.

This package is organized into three primary layers:

- domain: Core business logic, entities, and service interfaces.
- application: HTTP endpoints, controllers, and DTOs.
- infra: Framework integration, configuration, and dependency injection wiring.

The implementation logic will be added later; for now this module
simply marks the package and provides a convenient import root.
